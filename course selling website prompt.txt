Create a full-featured, single-page PDF selling website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a MySQL database. The website should have the following features:
I. Core Functionality & Content:
1. Course Listings: Display 8 distinct courses. For each course, show:
* Name (e.g., 'Web Development Fundamentals', 'Graphic Design Principles', 'Python for Data Science', 'Digital Marketing Mastery', 'Mobile App Development (React Native)', 'Cybersecurity Essentials', 'Cloud Computing with AWS', 'Project Management (PMP Prep')).
* A short description.
* Price in Indian Rupees (₹), using relatively low integer values (e.g., ₹49, ₹39, ₹59, ₹45, ₹69, ₹55, ₹79, ₹89).
* A relevant image for the course card (use Unsplash URLs if possible, ensuring they are distinct and appropriate for each topic, especially for 'Cybersecurity' and 'Cloud Computing').
* An "Add to Cart" button.
2. PDF Sales: The site sells PDF documents associated with these courses (simulated delivery).
II. User Management:
1. Registration Page (?view=register): Fields for Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password. Include basic validation (all fields required, valid email, password match, min length). Hash passwords securely.
2. Login Page (?view=login): Fields for Email/Username and Password.
3. User Roles: Implement 'user' and 'admin' roles.
III. Shopping Cart & Payment:
1. Shopping Cart Page (?view=cart):
* Managed using PHP sessions.
* Displays items added to the cart with their name, image, and price.
* Ability to remove items from the cart.
* Shows the total cart value in Rupees.
* Buttons: "Continue Shopping" (links to main courses) and "Proceed to Payment."
2. Add to Cart Functionality:
* "Add to Cart" buttons on course cards should use AJAX to add items to the session cart.
* Provide user feedback (e.g., "Item added!") and then redirect to the cart page.
* Dynamically update a cart item count in the header navigation.
3. Payment Page (?view=payment):
* Displays the total amount from the cart.
* Payment Gateway Simulation:
* Show a placeholder QR code (e.g., from api.qrserver.com, including the cart total in the QR data for simulation).
* Instructions for the user to scan, pay, and then enter details.
* Input fields for "Email Address (for PDF delivery)" (pre-fill if user is logged in) and "Transaction ID".
* Database Logging: On "Confirm Purchase":
* Save the email, transaction ID, list of purchased course names, total amount, and a timestamp to a transactions table in the database.
* Link the transaction to user_id if the user is logged in.
* Set an initial order_status of 'Pending'.
* Clear the cart from the session.
* Redirect to the main page with a success message (using a GET parameter that is then converted to a session flash message).
4. Back Navigation: "Back to Cart" button on the payment page.
IV. Admin Panel (?view=admin):
1. Accessible only to logged-in users with the 'admin' role.
2. View Transactions: Display all transactions from the database in a table, showing: Transaction ID, User (username or 'Guest'), Payer Email, Courses Purchased, Total Amount, Order Status, and Purchase Timestamp.
3. Confirm Orders: For transactions with 'Pending' status, provide a "Confirm" button. Clicking this should update the order_status in the database to 'Confirmed' and refresh the admin panel.
V. UI/UX & Styling ("Claude Sonnet 3.7" Aesthetic):
1. Modern, Clean Design: Use a professional and attractive layout.
2. Font: Use 'Open Sans' from Google Fonts.
3. Header: Make it sticky with a subtle gradient. Include the site title ("LearnSphere") and navigation links ("Courses", "Cart (count)", Login/Register or User Welcome/Logout/Admin).
4. Hero Slider (Main Page Only):
* Display a few featured courses (e.g., 3-4) with larger "hero images" (provide appropriate Unsplash URLs for these too) and their names/descriptions.
* Include navigation dots and auto-cycling.
* Buttons on slides should link to the respective course card on the page.
5. Animations:
* Implement subtle fade-in animations for sections as they scroll into view.
* Animate course cards (e.g., slight lift or fade-in) as they scroll into view.
6. Styling Details:
* Pill-shaped buttons with hover effects.
* Enhanced course card hover effects (lift/scale, shadow).
* Well-styled form inputs with focus states.
* Clear visual hierarchy for section titles (e.g., with an underline accent).
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
* Ensure the payment page layout (QR code and form) is well-aligned and responsive.
VI. Code Structure:
1. All code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) should be in a single index.php file.
2. Use PHP for backend logic, session management, and dynamic content generation.
3. Use JavaScript for client-side interactivity (AJAX, slider, animations).
VII. Database Schema:
Provide the SQL CREATE TABLE statements for:
1. users (id, username, email, password_hash, role, created_at)
2. transactions (id, user_id (nullable FK to users.id), email, transaction_id, courses_purchased, total_amount, order_status, purchase_timestamp)
VIII. Setup Instructions:
Briefly mention how to set up the database (create DB, tables, update PHP constants) and how to create an admin user (register then manually update role in DB).

database name should be pdf_store_v2 create the sql database also accordingly in separate file
